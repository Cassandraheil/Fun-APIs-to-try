            <p>I was looking at api's to spark a new project idea. I kept seeing a lot of really funny or specific api's that caught my attention. They weren't very useful in many situation but I really wanted to use them and see the information these API's spewed. So I just decided to make a page full of them all so I could check them out.</p>
